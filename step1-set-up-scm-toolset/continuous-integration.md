## Continuous Integration

Team members integrate their work frequently ---> Every integration is verified by an automated build and tests ---> Detect integration errors as early as possible.

"Continuous integration is the practice of working in small batches and using automated tests to detect and reject changes that introduce a regression."

### CI Server

CI Servers run build scripts and integration tests with the most recent version of the software on a schedule or upon every commit.

Common CI servers include Jenkins, TeamCity, and Bamboo.
