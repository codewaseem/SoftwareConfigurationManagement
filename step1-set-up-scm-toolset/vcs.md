### Version Control System (VCS)

Provides a repository that retains every version of every configuration item.

Serves as a central collaboration point.

#### Basic VC Operations

1. Create Repo - Git init
2. Add Files - Git add
3. Check Out - Download/Clone/Pull the repo
4. Status - Compare
5. Update - Merge/Pull Request
6. Check In - Push

#### Architectures of VCS

1. **Centralized**, such as Subversion<br/>
   Keeps the repo in central location, requires a network connection to perform version control operations.

2. **Distributed**, such as Git<br/>
   Keeps a local copy of the central repository. VC operations can be performed locally and synchronized with the central repo on demand.
